        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This cranberry sauce recipe uses fresh cranberries, sugar, and orange juice to make a Thanksgiving classic.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh Cranberries: Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li>Sugar: White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.</li>
            <li>Orange Juice: All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat orange juice in a saucepan</li>
            <li>Stir in sugar and cook until it dissolves</li>
            <li>Add cranberries and continue cooking, stirring often, until they start to pop</li>
            <li>Remove the sauce from heat and transfer it to a bowl -- the cranberry sauce will continue to thicken as it cools</li>
        </ol>
